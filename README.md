# LoadingScreenModule
Loading screen module on Unreal Engine
Works using slate widget and MoviePlayer. Provides async loading screen, working on different thread.
-easy connect
-no lag in animation
-fast load & work

Module loads very early, so images, fonts, etc should be loaded inside using file path.
